# nuclearFRET
an [ImageJ](http://imagej.net/Welcome)/[Fiji](https://fiji.sc) python script for [FRET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Förster_resonance_energy_transfer) (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer) calculation at the nuclear envelope or in the cytoplasm for FRET standard constructs.

The script generates either the FRET index map of semi-automatically extracted nuclear envelopes from nuclei and a list of mean FRET index per nucleus (`Nuclei workflow), or the FRET index map of FRET standard constructs 5AA and TRAF expressed in the cytoplasm (Whole cell workflow).  For step-by step visual guide of the protocol please refer to the following figure


Installation
